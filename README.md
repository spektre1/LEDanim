# LEDanim
Based on adafruit's neopixel libraries, this project provides additional animation capabilities.

# Why
This is part of my work learning how to do costume and prop design for cosplay
projects. One of my cosplays is Samus Aran from Metroid. I made her whole Varia
Suit, and I wanted to include the lights too.

The most interesting part is the ArmCannon, as this is my initial implementation
of this code. I expect to generalize what I learn while developing this into a
general purpose animation API so I can use this easily for other projects.

Follow armCannon.ino if you want to see my current progress.
